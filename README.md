# Java Learning Repository

Welcome to my Java learning repository! This repository is dedicated to exercises and practices from a course as part of my personal learning journey. Here, I'll be documenting my progress and storing code snippets related to fundamental concepts, data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), and inheritance in Java.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal study log, where I'll be organizing exercises and practices from the course I am currently undertaking. It will primarily contain:

- Code snippets for various exercises.
- Examples demonstrating key Java concepts.
- Practical exercises from the course.

## Repository Structure

- 📁 **Exercises:** Code snippets and solutions for exercises.
- 📁 **OOPPractices:** Practical examples related to object-oriented programming.
- 📁 **JavaFundamentals:** Code snippets exploring fundamental Java concepts.

## Note

This repository is intended for personal learning, and it will not feature complex projects. Larger projects and more advanced work will be housed in separate repositories.

## How to Contribute

While this repository is mainly for personal use, feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or share any insights. Let's grow together as Java learners!

Happy coding! 🚀
